<h1>Cheese is tasty. And I ain't crazy.</h1>
<h2>It makes me <i>drool.</i> As precious as a <i>jewel.</i></h2>
<h3>It makes me <u>roll my eyes</u> with pleasure. O, what a priceless <i>treasure!</i></h3>
<p>Cheese is made out of milk, usually from cows, goats, or sheep. The milk is first acidified using a bacterial culture or an acidic substance like vinegar or lemon juice. 
This causes the milk proteins to coagulate and form curds. The curds are then separated from the liquid, called whey, and processed further to create different types of cheese.
Cheese can be made with raw or pasteurized milk and can be flavored with various herbs, spices, or other ingredients. Different types of cheese can also be made with different types of
bacterial cultures or by using different processing methods, resulting in a wide variety of textures and flavors! That is fairly obvious, if I may say so myself.
I absolutely adore cheese and can't resist its <i>creamy and flavorful goodness!</i></p>
<hr>
<p>The enigmatic presence of holes in cheese holds within it a <u>profound and existential significance</u>, elevating the act of eating cheese into a metaphysical experience. 
These holes, aptly named "eyes," are not just a random occurrence in the cheese-making process but rather a powerful symbol of the beauty in imperfection, the capricious nature of 
existence, and the intricate interconnectedness of all things. In a world where we constantly strive for perfection, the presence of these holes can act as a humbling reminder that 
life is unpredictable, and unexpected challenges can add depth and meaning to our experiences. The drama lies in the fact that even something as seemingly insignificant as a piece of 
cheese can hold a deep philosophical significance, reminding us of the richness and complexity of our existence. So the next time you savor the creamy goodness of cheese, let the 
<i>holes within it</i> serve as a potent symbol of the <i>mysteries and wonders of life</i>.</p>

<p>Blue cheese is tasty. <br>Green cheese is tasty. <br>Red cheese is tasty. <br>Duh.</p>

<pWith each delectable bite of cheese, my taste buds explode with pleasure, while a wave of warmth spreads through my body, igniting a fiery passion within me and transporting
 me to a world of unparalleled ecstasy.</p>

<hr>
<p><i>Let this new motto for civilization itself guide us towards a brighter, more flavorful future.</i></p>

<h3>Poems of cheese:</h3>
<p>"Oh, Cheese!"<br><br>Oh, cheese! How rich and creamy,<br>
How tempting and divine!<br>
Your scent alone is dreamy,<br>
Your flavor's simply fine.<br>
<br>
From cheddar to brie to gouda,<br>
There's a cheese for every mood,<br>
And with a cracker or some pasta,<br>
You're sure to lift my mood.<br>

Whether melted on a pizza,<br>
Or in a grilled cheese sandwich sublime,<br>
You bring such joy and pleasure,<br>
To every meal, every time.<br>
<br>

Or blue and veined throughout,<br>
You still hold a special place,<br>
In many a foodie's heart.<br>
<br>
Oh, cheese! You are so versatile,<br>
So delicious, so beloved,<br>
From cheeseburgers to fondue,<br>
You're a food that's truly above.<br>

Life wouldn't be as dreamy as it seems.</p>

<p>"The Great Tradition"<br><br>Oh, Cheese! The dairy queen of all delights,<br>
Aged to perfection, mellowed to our taste,<br>
Its texture smooth, its flavor exquisite,<br>
A feast for tongue and soul, a treasure chased.<br>
<br>
Oh, how the curds doth dance within the vat,<br>
And whey doth separate with gentle ease,<br>
The magic of fermentation, like that<br>
Of a bard, who pens words with ease.<br>
<br>
The milk doth simmer, and then it coagulates,<br>
A cheese curd formed, its shape and size defined,<br>
A process centuries old, a tradition so great,<br>
Its aroma fills the air, like a song that's well-designed.<br>
<br>
From Cheddar, Brie, to Gouda, all unique,<br>
Each with a flavor that's rare and pure,<br>
Some crumbly, some gooey, a heavenly freak,<br>
Each slice, a treasure, of which we're sure.<br>
<br>
Oh, Cheese! How thee brings us such pleasure,<br>
A staple of many a meal, a treat so divine,<br>
From simple crackers to a gourmet treasure,<br>
A food that we cherish, like a Shakespearean line.<br>
<br>
So let us raise a glass, and give a cheer,<br>
To Cheese, the king of dairy, a food so dear.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Ode to Cheese"<br><br>Oh cheese, my dear and humble friend,<br>
A taste so rich, it never ends.<br>
From cheddar sharp to brie so soft,<br>
You make my taste buds dance aloft.<br>
<br>
Mozzarella, provolone, and Swiss,<br>
On sandwiches, you’re hard to miss.<br>
Gouda, havarti, and feta too,<br>
In salads, you make a tasty stew.<br>
<br>
From mac and cheese to pizza pie,<br>
You make my stomach sing and sigh.<br>
Oh cheese, your flavors are so vast,<br>
A bite of you, and time goes fast.<br>
<br>
You’re perfect on crackers and bread,<br>
Your goodness is what I’ve always said.<br>
So here’s to cheese, my one true love,<br>
May you forever reign above.</p>
